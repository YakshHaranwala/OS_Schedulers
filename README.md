This repository is an attempted solution to the OS concepts book.
The project description can be found in the chapter 5 of the book.

The extra addition to that project is that this version also calculates:
  1. Average Turnaround Time
  2. Average Waiting Time
  3. Average Response Time

It is assumed here that all the process arrive at the same time starting at t = 0 and that all the processes are non-preemptive.

Cheers,
Yaksh Haranwala
